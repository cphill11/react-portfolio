# Professional React-based SPA Digital Portfolio

## Description

Loading portfolio shows the user a page containing a header, a content section, and a footer.  Viewing the header presents the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

Viewing the navigation titles presents the user with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.  Clicking on a navigation title presents the user with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

Loading the portfolio the first time displays the About Me title and section are selected by default. Presenting the About Me section displays a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.

Presenting the Portfolio section displays titled images of 6 of the developer's applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.

Presenting the Contact section displays a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. Moving the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text triggers a notification that this field is required. Entering text into the email address field triggers a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.

Presenting the Resume section displays a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.  

Viewing the footer displays text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
